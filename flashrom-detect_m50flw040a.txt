Enabling flash write... FREG0: Flash Descriptor region (0x00000000-0x00000fff) is read-only.
FREG1: BIOS region (0x00180000-0x003fffff) is read-write.
FREG2: Management Engine region (0x00001000-0x0017ffff) is locked.
Not all flash regions are freely accessible by flashrom. This is most likely
due to an active ME. Please see https://flashrom.org/ME for details.
At least some flash regions are read protected. You have to use a flash
layout and include only accessible regions. For write operations, you'll
additionally need the --noverify-all switch. See manpage for more details.
